Installation:
You can now download visual studio community 2015, and it is free to individuals. There is a visual web developer express, but it doesn't have as many features.

Create a new project, asp.net web application with C#, using MVC.

You automatically have a website, run the application and you will see the page.

You can login, the password that it requires is very strict: letter, number, uppercase, and special character, like !, required. Definetly want to find a way to simplify the requirements. After logging out, and stopping the page, I want to find where my data: login name, and password were stored.
   If you go to server Explorer - defaultConnection, to tables, and select aspnetUsers and show data, you will see the email and password is saved. It kind of interesting that until I logged in, and stopped the application, none of the tables, nor the database connection was there. But it is interesting to see the database for the first time.

First step is to find the home page, or headers. Can see the header of the page says Application name, Home, about. There is also a jumbotron that says ASP.NET, asp.net is free web framework. So where is this master page?

Go to views->shared, and find the _Layout.cshtml page. This is obviously the master page. It has the navigation header, etc. There is also a @renderbody, which will change based on the specific view you use.

Next, go to views->Home, and open Index.cshtml, this is obviously the default home page. Interestingly, there is no @section start like laravel, it is pure html. So obvioulsy on the default home page, there is a controller calling this view "Index.cshtml".

Of course, there is a folder called controllers, the homeController has an Index function which returns "view()". Since the name of the view is not specified, it will automatically assume the view has the same name as the Function, thus the Index.cshtm view is to be returned. You can also see the views returned when people click on teh about and contact pages.

Going back to the master page, _Layout.cshtml, you can see the links to call the controllers and their functions (unlike laravel, there is no routing).

<li>@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")</li>
<li>@Html.ActionLink("About", "About", "Home")</li>
<li>@Html.ActionLink("Contact", "Contact", "Home")</li>

Comparing these links to the controller code, we can determine these links mean:
<li>@Html.ActionLink(Text, ControllerFunction, Controller)</li>

So text is what is displayed on the page, Controller Function is the function to be called in the controller (index, about, or contact), and the Controller to be used is last. Interestingly, you don't need to say "HomeController," just using "Home" is good enough.

After getting a bit familier with how controllers and views work, the first thing I like to dig into is how a user is registered.

User Registration
   Obviously, in Views->Account there is a Register.cshtml page.

Looking at the code for the Register.cshtml page you can see the code for the form:

@using (Html.BeginForm("Register", "Account", FormMethod.Post, new { @class = "form-horizontal", role = "form" }))

Unlike a link, forms don't have text. Thus, we can assume "Register" is the controller function name, and Account is the controller name. So lets go to the Controllers folder and find the AccountController and see what the register function does.

    Surprisingly, about half way down are the register functions. We see a GET and a POST for the register function.

// GET: /Account/Register
[AllowAnonymous]
public ActionResult Register()
{
    return View();
}

    This is neat, allowAnonymous means a guest can get this page. Again a view is not specified, so the view with the same name as the function will be called, Register.cshtml.

    Back to the regsiter POST, we see the function that handles this:

// POST: /Account/Register
[HttpPost]
[AllowAnonymous]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task<ActionResult> Register(RegisterViewModel model)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        var user = new ApplicationUser { UserName = model.Email, Email = model.Email };
        var result = await UserManager.CreateAsync(user, model.Password);
        if (result.Succeeded)
        {
            await SignInManager.SignInAsync(user, isPersistent:false, rememberBrowser:false);
                    
            // For more information on how to enable account confirmation and password reset please visit http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=320771
            // Send an email with this link
            // string code = await UserManager.GenerateEmailConfirmationTokenAsync(user.Id);
            // var callbackUrl = Url.Action("ConfirmEmail", "Account", new { userId = user.Id, code = code }, protocol: Request.Url.Scheme);
            // await UserManager.SendEmailAsync(user.Id, "Confirm your account", "Please confirm your account by clicking <a href=\"" + callbackUrl + "\">here</a>");

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }
        AddErrors(result);
    }

    // If we got this far, something failed, redisplay form
    return View(model);
}

    After looking at this code, it is not obvouis how to add new properties to the user account, like: JobTitle or gravatar (image of user). Sometimes you could also add a role to the user model, but by default, the project includes a couple of Role tables "AspNetRoles" and AspNetUserRoles, will look into this later. For now, we want to find how to add properties to the user, and then simplify the password requirements.

It's pretty obvious that in the POST register function this is storing the user properties:
var user = new ApplicationUser { UserName = model.Email, Email = model.Email };

We should be able to change this to:
var user = new ApplicationUser { UserName = model.Email, Email = model.Email, JobTitle = model.JobTitle };

You can right click on the work "ApplicationUser" and select, "go to definition."

It takes you to IdentityModels.cs, in there is a link to a page that shows you how to add properties using the package manager console, but the code doesn't work. THanks ... I figured it out below..

title: Adding a new property to the AspNetUser table

Go to tools->nuget package manager -> package manager console.

In the console, type "enable-migrations", you will see a new folder in your project called "migrations."

To add new properties in the IdentityModel.cs, the following adds a job title property:

public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser 
{
    public async Task<ClaimsIdentity> GenerateUserIdentityAsync(UserManager<ApplicationUser> manager)
    {
        // Note the authenticationType must match the one defined in CookieAuthenticationOptions.AuthenticationType
        var userIdentity = await manager.CreateIdentityAsync(this, DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie);
        // Add custom user claims here
        return userIdentity;
    }

    //Add new user properties
    public string JobTitle { get; set; }
}

Note: the microsoft website tells you to add new properties like this:
public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser  { public DateTime BirthDate { get; set; } }

However, this results in errors and doesn't work.

After you added the new property, go the the package manager, and type:
add-migration
for the name type "JobTitle"
You will see a new file in the migrations folder.

Then, in the package manager console, type "update-database", go to the AspNetUsers table and you will see the new column "JobTitle"..cool

---------
title: Updating the view and controller code for the new user property.

    When a user is logged in, the user can click on their name and they are taken to their profile page. The profile page view is located in Views->Manage->Index.cshtml. (There are a ton of tutorials on how to update register page, so we won't go over it).

   The Manage->Index, or profile page, seems like a waste; it makes the user go to another page to change the password, and has some strong verification stuff. Lets modify the page so that they user can change their account profile (email, password, jobTitle) directly on this page.

   So how does a person get to their profile page? Looking at the master page in Views->Shared->_Layout.cshtml we see the code 

@Html.Partial("_LoginPartial")

   The _LoginPartial page is also in the shared folder, it has the following code:

@using Microsoft.AspNet.Identity
@if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
{
    using (Html.BeginForm("LogOff", "Account", FormMethod.Post, new { id = "logoutForm", @class = "navbar-right" }))
    {
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()

    <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
        <li>
            @Html.ActionLink("Hello " + User.Identity.GetUserName() + "!", "Index", "Manage", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { title = "Manage" })
        </li>
        <li><a href="javascript:document.getElementById('logoutForm').submit()">Log off</a></li>
    </ul>
    }
}
else
{
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Register", "Register", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "registerLink" })</li>
        <li>@Html.ActionLink("Log in", "Login", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "loginLink" })</li>
    </ul>
}

    This is interesting, if a user is logged in: Show a link to the profile page, or a link to log off. Else show links to register or log in. Looking at this, we can see the code we need to modify. When a user clicks the profile link they are routed to the ManageController's index function.

ManageController:
// GET: /Manage/Index
public async Task<ActionResult> Index(ManageMessageId? message)
{
    ViewBag.StatusMessage =
        message == ManageMessageId.ChangePasswordSuccess ? "Your password has been changed."
        : message == ManageMessageId.SetPasswordSuccess ? "Your password has been set."
        : message == ManageMessageId.SetTwoFactorSuccess ? "Your two-factor authentication provider has been set."
        : message == ManageMessageId.Error ? "An error has occurred."
        : message == ManageMessageId.AddPhoneSuccess ? "Your phone number was added."
        : message == ManageMessageId.RemovePhoneSuccess ? "Your phone number was removed."
        : "";

    var userId = User.Identity.GetUserId();
    var model = new IndexViewModel
    {
        HasPassword = HasPassword(),
        PhoneNumber = await UserManager.GetPhoneNumberAsync(userId),
        TwoFactor = await UserManager.GetTwoFactorEnabledAsync(userId),
        Logins = await UserManager.GetLoginsAsync(userId),
        BrowserRemembered = await AuthenticationManager.TwoFactorBrowserRememberedAsync(userId)
    };
    return View(model);
}

    So, if the user changed their password (on a different page), they are sent back to this page and a message is displayed. There is also a bunch of other stuff for StatusMessage I don't want to use.  Then the controller gets the id of the user, and stores the user Properties in a model, and passes them to the view.
    Not sure how to modify this yet, will come back.


----------
Making a blog post

   Like the Laravel project, lets create a model "Item" that is a blog that can be used to create multiple blog pages of "Items." The Items can be IT stuff, like Devices, Access Points, Switches, Phones, Routers.
   Stealing the Item model from Laravel, Items has the following properties:
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->enum('type', ['device', 'phone','ap','switch','news']);
            $table->string('title',40);  //max length 40
            $table->text('description');
            $table->string('imagePath',255)->nullable();
            $table->string('documentPath',255)->nullable();
            $table->boolean('approved')->default(false);
            $table->integer('user_id');
            $table->timestamps();

   Of course this is laravel code, making a new model in asp.net is different. In Laravel, it really doesn't matter where you start: model, view, or controller, because each is made individual. Asp.net is much different due to EntityFramework, EF.
    Using EF is very powerfull and saves a ton of time. First, you create the model, then you create the controller. When creating the controller, you can select the model for the controller. And when you are finished, EF creates all the controller code and CRUD views for you.

    So again, in ASP.NET, always create the model first, then the controller.


-------
Making models
    Go to the models folder, right click, select add, then class, keep the default C# class, change the name at the bottom to your new Model name.

using System;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace aspNETfirstProject.Models  // aspNETfirstProject is just the name of the project
{
    /*    In Laravel, this would be in the migration file, 
     *    then do a php artisan migrate for laravel to create the table
          
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->enum('type', ['device', 'phone','ap','switch','news']);
            $table->string('title',40);  //max length 40
            $table->text('description');
            $table->string('imagePath',255)->nullable();
            $table->string('documentPath',255)->nullable();
            $table->boolean('approved')->default(false);
            $table->integer('user_id');
            $table->timestamps();
 
     */

    public enum Type
    {
        device, phone, ap, switch
    }

    public class Item
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }  //All int's and datetime are required by default

        [Required]
        public Type Type { get; set; }

        [Required(ErrorMessage = "A Title is required")]
        public string Title { get; set; }

        [Required(ErrorMessage = "A Description is required")]
        public string Description { get; set; }

        public string ImagePath { get; set; } //nullable
        public string DocumentPath { get; set; }

        [DefaultValue(false)]
        public bool Approved { get; set; }

        public int UserID { get; set; }   //Foriegn key to user's table
        public DateTime Created_at { get; set; }
        public DateTime Updated_at { get; set; }
        
    }
}

    Use the package manager to add the table to the database.
After you added the new property, go the the package manager, and type:
add-migration "Item"

Then, in the package manager console, type "update-database"
...didn't work...lol

   WHY DON"T THEY HAVE GOOD DOCS???? Couldn't even google the answer. Finally figured it out. Go tothe Migrations folder, and open the Configuration.cs file. Change teh AutoMigrationsEnabled to true.

public Configuration()
        {
            AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = true; // CHANGE TO TRUE!!
            ContextKey = "aspNETfirstProject.Models.ApplicationDbContext";
        }

    Now run: add-migration "Item"

    This time, you will see the new migration file has code creating the new table for you. If you get an error, you may have to delete an old migration file.

   Then run: update-database

   Now you should see the new table in the database. If you don't try to refresh server explorer, and go to Build and run build solution.

   Course, you could manually build the table (like you would if the database already existed). Or there is the option to recreate database everytime a model changes (losing all your data).
-----
error "The model backing the 'ApplicationDbContext' context has changed since the database was created. Consider using Code First Migrations to update the database (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238269)."

You get this if you add a new model, but it is not in the database. Add the new model using code first migrations, like I did. Or manually create the new table, or use recreate database everytime model changes option.

Making a change to a model.

  Very easy to do. So the item model has an issue. "Type" is a keyword, and makes a query impossible. Thus, had to change "Type" to "ItemType".
   Did this, did a "add-migration "itemType", checked the migration file, it dropped the Type Column and added the ItemType column...perfect. So did "update-database" and it's fixed. Sweet and simple. Easier than laravel.
 
-----
   After this, created a controller, selected mcv5 contoller with views using entity framework (it creates all the index, edit, create views for you). Then selected the new Item for the model. Selected the default data context class  "applicationDBcontext", so that the table will be created in the default database.
   When EF is done, it will create a new ItemsController with code for Index, create, delete, details and edit. And it will create a new folder in Views called Items with all of the views. Pretty nice, but of course they will need some changes.

   Next, create a link in the master page, Shared folder -> _Layout file, and add a link:

<div class="navbar-collapse collapse">
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")</li>
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("About", "About", "Home")</li>
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Contact", "Contact", "Home")</li>
            <li>@Html.ActionLink("Devices", "Index", "Items", new { itemType = "devices" }, null)</li>
        </ul>
        @Html.Partial("_LoginPartial")
    </div>
 
   This creates a link using ItemsController's index() function and opens a devices page, but the url is ugly: 

http://localhost:54996/Items?itemType=devices

Instead, a new function was added to the ItemsController called "Devices"
Now there is a pretty URL "http://localhost:54996/Items/Devices"

    Next, the devices function needs to be made. The hard part was the where clause with type enum. The ItemType is a "device, phone,switch,etc". However, it is stored in the database as an int.

ItemsController:
// GET: Devices
public ActionResult Devices()
{
            
    return View("Index", db.Items.Where(d => d.ItemType == ItemType.device).ToList());

    // return View("Index",db.Items.Where(d => d.Type == "devices").ToList();
    //This would work if "Type" was a string (type is "device,phone, ap, switch")
    // But Type is enum, so it's an Int in the database.

}

The view created by default is an ugly grid. Also, it displays things that should be hidden like ItemType, ImagePath, DocPath, Approved. Plus, the user table was not joined, so it is showing UserID. see picture:   

    The create page also has issues. The itemType should be hidden, if a user is on the devices page, and hits the create button, itemType variable "device" should be passed to the create page and made hidden. Approved property should not be on this page (a post has to be approved by the admin). The created_at and updated_at properties should be done on the backend.
 insert pic


   First, we need a link in the index view to the create page. The create page can be for different ItemTypes, thus we need to pass the ItemType. The create button has been slightly modified to pass the parameter, and you have to be logged in to see the create button (because the blog post requires a userID):

Index view:
@* IF user is logged in, show create POST button*@
@if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
{
    <p>
        @Html.ActionLink("Create New", "Create", "Items", new { itemType = "device" }, null)
    </p>
} else
{
    <p>Log in to Create a Post.</p>

}



=====
   First the create page needs to be updated. It's interesting that the default code recognizes an enum type, so it automatically creates a drop down.

<div class="form-group">
    @Html.LabelFor(model => model.ItemType, htmlAttributes: new { @class = "control-label col-md-2" })
    <div class="col-md-10">
        @Html.EnumDropDownListFor(model => model.ItemType, htmlAttributes: new { @class = "form-control" })
        @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.ItemType, "", new { @class = "text-danger" })
    </div>
</div>

<div class="form-group">
    @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Title, htmlAttributes: new { @class = "control-label col-md-2" })
    <div class="col-md-10">
        @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Title, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = "form-control" } })
        @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.Title, "", new { @class = "text-danger" })
    </div>
</div>

   One interesting thing is that there is no bootstrap "required" field. Yet, the form's required fields are validated before the POST. There is nothing in the view that indicates where this is happening. This is also bad because the created_at and updated_at fields are done on the back end.



=====
Queries

Users.ToList().Where(user => user.UserId != 3456);

Where queries:
public class Draft
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int PublicationId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

return View(db.Drafts.Where(d => d.Name == "foo"));

public ActionResult Index(int id, string filter)
{
    return View(db.Drafts.Where(d => d.Name == filter));
}

public ActionResult Index(int id, string filter)
{
    return View(db.Drafts.Where(d => d.Name == filter && d.PublicationId == id));
}




=======

Enum Query
public enum DepartmentNames 
{ 
    English, 
    Math, 
    Economics 
}     
 
public partial class Department 
{ 
    public int DepartmentID { get; set; } 
    public DepartmentNames Name { get; set; } 
    public decimal Budget { get; set; } 
}

var department = (from d in context.Departments 
                        where d.Name == DepartmentNames.English 
                        select d).FirstOrDefault(); 


Where with sort query, filtering, search
public ViewResult Index(string sortOrder, string searchString)
{
    //Variables to be sent back to the view
    ViewBag.NameSortParm = String.IsNullOrEmpty(sortOrder) ? "name_desc" : "";
    ViewBag.DateSortParm = sortOrder == "Date" ? "date_desc" : "Date";

    //Get all students
    var students = from s in db.Students
                   select s;

    //Where query
    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(searchString))
    {
        students = students.Where(s => s.LastName.Contains(searchString)
                               || s.FirstMidName.Contains(searchString));
    }

   //Sort based on parameter
    switch (sortOrder)
    {
        case "name_desc":
            students = students.OrderByDescending(s => s.LastName);
            break;
        case "Date":
            students = students.OrderBy(s => s.EnrollmentDate);
            break;
        case "date_desc":
            students = students.OrderByDescending(s => s.EnrollmentDate);
            break;
        default:
            students = students.OrderBy(s => s.LastName);
            break;
    }

    return View(students.ToList());
}


------
Using enum and nullable properties. int, datatime, and any decimal are required by default.
Strings are nullable by default unless  you use the DataAnnotation "required"

 public enum Grade
    {
        A, B, C, D, F
    }

    public class Enrollment
    {
        public int EnrollmentID { get; set; }
        public int CourseID { get; set; }
        public int StudentID { get; set; }
        public Grade Grade { get; set; }  //nullable
        
        public virtual Course Course { get; set; }
        public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
    }

Complex classes - required, max length, custom display name, custom error message.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

 public int ID { get; set; }
        [Required]
        [StringLength(50)]
        [Display(Name = "Last Name")]
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        [Required]
        [StringLength(50, ErrorMessage = "First name cannot be longer than 50 characters.")]
        [Column("FirstName")]
        [Display(Name = "First Name")]
        public string FirstMidName { get; set; }
        [DataType(DataType.Date)]
        [DisplayFormat(DataFormatString = "{0:yyyy-MM-dd}", ApplyFormatInEditMode = true)]
        [Display(Name = "Enrollment Date")]
        public DateTime EnrollmentDate { get; set; }

        [Display(Name = "Full Name")]
        public string FullName
        {
            get
            {
                return LastName + ", " + FirstMidName;
            }
        }
    
ICollection vs public virtual - If a navigation property can hold multiple entities (as in many-to-many or one-to-many relationships), its type must be a list in which entries can be added, deleted, and updated, such as ICollection. Vs the Enrollment class - if the studentID or CourseID is deleted, then the enrollment no longer exists and can be deleted.
    ICollection and virtuals are not necessary, but it makes the sql easier later on.

-------------
Validation
[CreditCard]: Validates the property has a credit card format.
Example:

[Compare]: Validates two properties in a model match.
Example:
    [DataType(DataType.Password)]
    [Display(Name = "New password")]
    public string NewPasword{ get; set; }

    [DataType(DataType.Password)]
    [Display(Name = "Confirm the New Pasword")]
    [Compare("NewPasword", ErrorMessage = "Password doesn´t mach.")]
    public string ConfirmPasword{ get; set; }

[EmailAddress]: Validates the property has an email format.
Example:

[Phone]: Validates the property has a telephone format.
Example:

[Range]: Validates the property value falls within the given range.
Example:

[RegularExpression]: Validates that the data matches the specified regular expression.
Example:

[Required]: Makes a property required.
Example:

[StringLength]: Validates that a string property has at most the given maximum length.
Example:

[Url]: Validates the property has a URL format.

   You would think this would be easy, the code would be in the AccountController, but it isn't. The password model, only requires that the length be 6 char long.
  You actually have to go to App_Start->IdentityConfig.cs. In it you should find the class ApplicationUserManager and a static factory method called Create(). That's where the user manager class is configured, including the server-side validation rules for passwords are defined. For example:

manager.PasswordValidator = new PasswordValidator
{
    RequiredLength = 6,
    RequireNonLetterOrDigit = true,
    RequireDigit = true,
    RequireLowercase = true,
    RequireUppercase = true,
};
